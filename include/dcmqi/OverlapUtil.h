/** Class that analyzes the frame-based segment structures of a given segmentation object.
 *  It provides the following main functionality:
 *  - Grouping of "physical" frames by their position in space (called "logical frames"), i.e.
 *    frames that are at the same position in space are grouped together.
 *  - For every logical frame (i.e. position in space), it lists the segments found at this
 *    position together with their respective physical frame number
 *  - Return physical frame numbers for a given segment number
 *  - Building an overlap matrix that stores for each arbitrary segment pair whether
 *    they overlap or not.
 *  - Return groups of segments, that no two overlapping segments will be in the same group.
 *    This will not necessarily return the optimal solution, but a solution that should be good enough.
 *    For the method used see getNonOverlappingSegments().
